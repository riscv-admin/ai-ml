# AI/ML SIG Charter

**Goals**

* Optimize a full software stack to support ML, AI and NLP applications for RISC-V architecture.

* Specify the benchmarks, performance metrics, and the evaluation methodology that will be used to track performance comparisons of optimized vs. current implementations and vs. other architectures such as ARM.

* Propose software-hardware co-optimizations for better support of the target applications.


**Scope**

* Evaluate the current support level for new emerging extensions such as the vector V, Zvediv, and P extensions as well as support for data types popular im ML applications (BFloat16, int8, int4, ...etc).

* Define the success metrics in terms of optimization coverage, functionality, energy, performance evaluation, and code size.

* Arrange and coordinate efforts between developers from different entities willing to contribute to the optimization of the SW stack. 

* Collaborate with the simulation infrastructure working group to get proper evaluation platforms (functional simulators & cycle-timing simulator). 

* Collaborate with other related task groups (V extension group): discuss their proposals’ effect on our target applications and to propose our own based on our analysis.

* Responsible for ongoing oversight and monitoring of the evolving ML/AI software stack and related aspects of RISC-V architecture.
